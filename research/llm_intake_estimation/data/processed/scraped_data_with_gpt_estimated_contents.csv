They tend to be high in fat and protein while also containing some carbohydrates. The following estimates are for 100 grams of hot dog sausages:

1. **Calories**: These are likely to be high because they contain both fat and protein.
2. **Protein**: Given the meat content, they are a good source of protein.
3. **Fat**: Processed and jarred hot dog sausages tend to have a high fat content.
4. **Carbohydrates**: There may be some carbohydrates from fillers and seasonings but generally not a large amount.

Pea stew, especially when it comes as an instant product like the one by Kania, likely contains a mix of dehydrated peas, vegetables, and potentially some seasonings or additives. Generally, dehydrated peas retain most of their nutritional content but lose some water content.

Considering it's a stew, it would typically rehydrate and absorb some water, but the core nutritional components per 100 grams when prepared should still reflect the nutrient density of the peas and vegetables, albeit slightly lower due to the dilution with water. Compared to fresh pea stew, instant varieties might have more sodium and potentially other preservatives.

From my knowledge of typical pea stew and instant versions of food:
- Peas are relatively high in calories, protein, and carbohydrates.
- Instant stew mixes might have reduced actual nutrient density per 100g due to added water.

Hence:
Calories: 80 kcal - typical for a rehydrated, hearty soup.
Protein: 3.5 g - pea-based dishes are protein-rich for vegetables, but slightly reduced when rehydrated.
Fat: 1 g - negligible considering it's mostly from peas and vegetables.
Carbohydrates: 14 g - peas and added vegetables contribute to this value.
